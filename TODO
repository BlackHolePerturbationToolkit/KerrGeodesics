TODO list
---------

- Add documentation
- Decide how best to parameterize inclination: Scott recommended theta_inc (currently using theta_min)									[DONE:Niels]
- Implement equations for ELQ and Freqs for polar orbits (theta_min = pi)																[ELQ done for e=0 case:Niels]
- Implement functions to compute the orbit and related quantities (four velocity, etc) as a function of time
- Improve calculation time for non-generic orbits by using simpler formula for i.e., Schwarzschild and equatorial/spherical orbits
- Implement equations for case a=M
- Check sign of theta and phi frequencies for retrograde orbits (currently they are negative)											[DONE: phi changes sign by theta should not, agrees with Scott's code:Niels]
- Implement function to check if a set of parameters corresponds to a stable bound orbit
- Make functions for ELQ and freqs work for analytic values of a,p,e,theta_inc
- Decide option for when returning analytic result to keep M  																			[trying something for ELQ e=0 cases M_:1 as an optional argument]
- If we are allow M as a paramater make sure the units are a=[M], p=[M], e=[1], theta=[1]
