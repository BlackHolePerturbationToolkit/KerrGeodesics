TODO list
---------

- Add documentation
- Decide how best to parameterize inclination: Scott recommended theta_inc (currently using theta_min)
- Implement equations for ELQ and Freqs for polar orbits (theta_min = pi)
- Implement functions to compute the orbit and related quantities (four velocity, etc) as a function of time
- Improve calculation time for non-generic orbits by using simpler formula for i.e., Schwarzschild and equatorial/spherical orbits
