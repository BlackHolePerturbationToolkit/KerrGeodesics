# KerrGeodesics Initial Conditions branch

Copyright 2017-2020 Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit

The KerrGeodesics package provides a set of functions for calculating
properties of bound timelike geodesic orbits about a Kerr black hole.

Further details can be found on the [package homepage](https://bhptoolkit.org/KerrGeodesics).

The point of this branch is to develop the functionality of generating geodesics from initial conditions.
