    "This is the core function of the package, similar to the KerrGeoOrbitFunction. When either NearHorizonGeoOrbit or NearHorizonGeoOrbitClass are called, a NearHorizonGeoOrbitFunction object is returned. It contains an association from which the geodesic trajectory as well as a number of orbital information can be accessed. See the NearHorizonGeodesics tutorial for more informations and examples."
